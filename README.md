# IBM application test
This application returns information about movies from a database.

## Booting it up
Well, you've just gotta run MovieTitles to get it running. It'll start up at port 8090.

## Accessing it
You can access it through this link: http://localhost:8090/api/movie/title?title=MOVIE_SUBSTR. Just change MOVIE_SUBSTR to something and it'll return movie names matching the request.

### Example
Here we're looking for Spiderman movies
